### Understanding the difference between a population and a sample:
- A population is the collection of all items of interest to our study and is usually denoted with an
uppercase N. The numbers we've obtained when using a population are called parameters.
- A sample is a subset of the population and is denoted with a lowercase N and the numbers we've obtained
when working with the sample are called statistics.
- Populations are hard to define and hard to observe in real life.
- A sample, however, is much easier to gather, it is less time consuming and less costly time and resources
are the main reasons we prefer drawing samples compared to analyzing an entire population. 
- A sample must be both <b>random and representative</b> for an insight, to be precise.
- A random sample is collected when each member of the sample is chosen from the population strictly by
chance.
- A representative sample is a subset of the population that accurately reflects the members of the entire
population.

### The fundamental of descriptive statistics:
- We can classify data in two main ways based on its type and on its measurement level
- Categorical data represents groups or categories.
- Numerical data represents numbers. It is divided into two groups: discrete and continuous. Discrete data can be usually counted in a finite matter, while continuous is infinite and impossible to count.
- There are two qualitative levels: nominal and ordinal. The nominal level represents categories that cannot be put in any order, while ordinal represents categories that can be ordered.
- There are two quantitative levels: interval and ratio. They both represent “numbers”, however, ratios have a true zero, while intervals don’t.
- Usually temperature is expressed in Celsius or Fahrenheit. But Why? Because they are both interval variables. That's why we should understand this section. 
- Ratio has a true 0. But Interval don't have true 0.

### Visiualization techniques for Catagorical variables: 
Visualizing data is the most intuitive way to interpret it, so it's an invaluable skill. It is much easier to visualize data if we know its type and measurement level.As we may recall, there are two types of variables, categorical and numerical, here, we will focus on categorical variables. Some of the most common ways to visualize them are frequency distribution tables, bar charts, pie charts and Perito diagrams. A Parado diagram is nothing more than a special type of bar chart where categories are shown in descending order of frequency. It is special type of bar chart.
Frequency is the number of occurence each items. The peruto diagram combines the strong sides of the bar and the pie chart. It is easy to compare the data both between categories and as a part of the total. If this was a market share graph, We can easily see the market share of the top two or top five companies. Finally, it is named after Fred Operator. You may have heard of another idea of is the Parado Principle, also known as the 80 20 rule.
It states that 80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the causes. A real life example is a statement by Microsoft that by fixing 20 percent of its software bugs, they manage to solve 80 percent of the problems customers experience. A Perito diagram can reveal information like that, it is designed to show how totals change with each additional category and provide us with a better understanding of our data.

<i>Important note: I have completed an important exercise on catagorical variables where I had to show bar chart, pie chart and peruto diagram after doing calculation. You can try it on. This exercise on this Ms Excel worksheet ( 2.3.Categorical-variables.Visualization-techniques-exercise.xlsx )</i>
